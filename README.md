# Chordify:

#### Project Description:

The Chordify interface connects Hooke's Law theory with Spotify and YouTube, allowing users to explore a range of songs based on specific chord progressions. Once the user inputs the desired chord progression, the application fetches matching songs and adds them to a Spotify playlist. Additionally, it creates a YouTube playlist that lists tutorials for the songs with the specified chord progression for an instrument of the user's choosing.
